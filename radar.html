    RADAR provides a warning to help recognize potential dangers and when to protect ourselves.

    RADAR is a series of steps to help you manage the risks you face.

           Be aware of what is going on around you – be on the lookout for suspicious people and for situations that could pose a danger. 
           Be aware of how others perceive you – are your actions or dress inadvertently attracting unwanted attention?  Are you wearing jewelry, using a camera, working on a laptop, or flashing money that might grab the attention of a criminal?
           Being able to recognize dangers lets us begin to figure out ways to reduce the risks. This is where it’s important to trust your instincts. If you have a bad feeling about something it’s a warning sign. Don’t dismiss it – listen to what that voice in the back of your head is saying or that uneasy feeling in your stomach is telling you.  For example, when you walk in to a crowded bus terminal, you recognize that there is a risk of being pickpocketed.

        <p id="radarp2"><h4>Step 2: Assess your options</h4>
          Now that you have recognized a potentially dangerous situation, what can you do in order to reduce the risk you face? In most situations, you will have choices to make. Identify as many options as you can.  For example, you can mitigate the risk of going out at night by traveling in a group, by using a trusted taxi or even by choosing to return home at an earlier hour.
