     OIG is a resource for those who have been harmed by misconduct or criminal wrongdoing by a fellow Volunteer or Peace Corps Staff.  They are independent from Peace Corps with law enforcement officers who have the unique authorities to help seek a fair resolution and, in appropriate cases, to seek prosecution in the United States or host country.
